# Hi, I am [Deepak Kharah](https://www.deepakkharah.com/) ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

-   I am a software engineer passionate about **learning** and **building**.
-   Currently working at **[Contentstack](https://github.com/contentstack)**.
-   Worked extensively on web technologies.
-   Design solutions for enterprise products.
-   Write code that ~~machines~~ **humans** can easily understand.

## A brief introduction

As a full-stack developer passionate about building elegant and human-comprehensible code, I specialize in developing scalable products for businesses using web technologies like JavaScript, React, Node, and more.

My approach to software development involves anticipating gaps in the product during planning, which helps shape the result. This has allowed me to create core features critical to closing deals with prospects.

## A Glimpse of My Work at Contentstack

-   I developed a standalone Rich text editor using ReactJS
-   I created the Live preview feature for the product, bringing significant business to the company.
-   I developed an extension framework that followed the DRY principle, helping the new marketplace for the company.
-   And many more...

## What do I do in my free time?

I maintain law and order in our galaxy. ðŸ¤«

I like to ride or learn when I take a break from patrolling. So, either I'll be on my bike exploring new places or at home learning random new things and writing them down (hoping to use that knowledge in the future).

Also, I make random stuff in [**Codepen**](https://codepen.io/deepak_kharah), [**Github**](https://github.com/Deepak-Kharah/), or my **local machine** (I should push them soon ðŸ¤”).
